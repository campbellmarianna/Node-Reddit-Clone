# Node Reddit Clone

To get into the real meat and potatoes of web development I will be building directly upon Resourceful and Restful patterns + multiply and associate resources by building a clone of Reddit:

- [Reddit.js](https://www.makeschool.com/academy/track/reddit-clone-in-node-js)

## What will I be doing:
- Implementing a large scale application using Express, Handlebars, and MongoDB/Mongoose
- Implementing an authentication flow through JWTs that allows users to sign up, log in, and log out, and restricts functionality based on authentication status
- Investigating how to use the populate method in Mongoose for advanced associations
- Implementing more intricate tests for CRUD apps as well as for authentication flows.

## What tools will I be using:
1. Node.js
2. Express.js
3. MongoDB & Mongoose (ODM)
4. JSON Web Tokens (JWT)
